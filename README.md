# Retail-_Sales_-Databricks_-Dashboard
 Project Overview
A brief, clear, and engaging summary of your project.

üöÄ About Retail-Sales
This project provides a comprehensive analysis of retail sales data to uncover key trends, performance metrics, and insights that can inform business strategies. The analysis is built using SQL queries within the Databricks environment, leveraging its scalable and efficient processing capabilities.

The goal is to provide a robust framework for:

Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Utilizing Databricks SQL to cleanse and transform raw data.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Running ad-hoc queries to visualize and understand sales trends over time, identify top-performing products, and analyze customer behavior.

Dashboarding: Creating interactive visualizations in Databricks to make insights easily accessible.

üì¶ Data
Describe the dataset you used, including its source and a brief description of its contents. Mention how the data is stored in Databricks (e.g., as a Delta Lake table).

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
List the programming languages, libraries, and tools used in the project.

Platform: Databricks

Language: SQL (specifically, Databricks SQL)

Data Storage: Delta Lake

Tools: Databricks SQL Editor, [e.g., Databricks Dashboards, Databricks Notebooks]

üìã Installation & Usage
Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to set up and use your project. Since it's on Databricks, the process is different from a local repository.

Access Databricks Workspace: You will need access to a Databricks workspace.

Upload Data: Upload the raw data to a location accessible by Databricks, such as a cloud storage bucket (e.g., AWS S3, Azure Blob Storage).

Create Tables: Use the provided SQL scripts to create the necessary tables in Databricks from the uploaded data.

File: databricks_setup/create_tables.sql

Run Analysis: Execute the main analysis queries.

File: sql_analysis/retail_sales_analysis.sql
